            <p>My name is Javori but I go by Javi. I'm a full-stack web developer based in the Denver-Metro area.<br>
            <span class="about-description">I have a passion for coding and I am a creator at heart. My love for creating is what drives me to continue learning as much as I can and apply my
                skills to real world projects. Using the free time I had from the current pandemic, I sharpened my skills and continued to practice everyday to become a better coder than I was the day before.
                My coding journey is everlasting and there's always more to learn, so I hope I can be able to use my expertise to inspire many and contribute to the advancement of techonlogy.
